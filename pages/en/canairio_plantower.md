## Overview

The objective of this guide is to provide an easy-to-follow description of the process to construct a device for measuring air quality, temperature, and humidity using the **CanAirIO firmware**. It will provide a basic guide on how to connect each of the sensors to the development board, as well as how to load and configure the **CanAirIO firmware**. The focus will be on practicality and clarity, avoiding technical details to ensure that the process can be easily understood and replicated by anyone.

This guide covers the construction of a device that utilizes the **Plantower PMS7003/G7** sensor for measuring **PM2.5** particulate matter, the **SHT31** sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, and the **TTGO T-Display** development board, which features an **ESP32** chip and a 1.14-inch display.

Please note that it is a general diagram, for details of pin connections please review the datasheet and pinout diagram of each component.

## Basic connection

You need to connect the **Plantower PMS7003/G7** sensor and the **SHT31** sensor to the **TTGO T-Display** development board. You should solder the cables and connect each cable to its corresponding pin as shown in the previous schematic.

You'll also need a cellphone charger with a USB-C cable to provide power to the TTGO T-Display development board. Once all the components have been connected correctly, you can use a plastic box to protect all the components as shown in the following image.

Other alternatives for upload the CanAirIO firmware, [here](https://canair.io/docs/firmware_upload.html).

## Firmware Configuration (CLI)

**CanAirIO CLI** (Command Line Interface) is an easy-to-use tool that allows you to configure your device through a console or web console. You donâ€™t need a mobile phone or any special operating system - all you need is a browser (such as Chrome or Edge) or a serial terminal interface.
